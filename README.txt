welcome to my chess app . 
currently the application is still in basic development , moving figures getting input printing the board and so on. 
it appears that the chess game has more specail cases than it looks like . 
at first all was implemented very nicely with eceptions and hadling , but because of the very expencive run time , i had to back of that idea , and return to message passing  between functions , and for each message i get other treatment .


future features :

gui - c# or web ( AJAX )

PVP  - over the network

blog with posts about highlights from previous games , expert game overviews, and online game option { logging in with facebook } , and fully functioning elo system

AI - currently its only in the thoughts . will be implemented most likley in C
